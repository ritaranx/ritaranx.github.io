My name is Ran Xu. I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), co-advised by [Prof. Carl Yang](https://cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) and [Prof. Joyce Ho](https://joyceho.github.io/).
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree (with Highest Honors) from the Department of Computer Science, [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2021, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi).

My current research interest focuses on graph learning, natural language processing and their biomedical applications.
Feel free to drop me an email (`ran.xu at emory dot edu`) if you have any questions about my research, or want to discuss about potential collaborations.
