My name is Ran Xu. I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), co-advised by [Prof. Carl Yang](https://cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) and [Prof. Joyce C. Ho](https://joyceho.github.io/).
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree (with Highest Honors) from the Department of Computer Science, [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2021, where I worked with [Prof. Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi).

My current research interest focuses on large language models, with a special interest on augmented (e.g. [retrieval augmented](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17952), [tool-augmented](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1245/)) language models and their [biomedical applications](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1241/).
I have also worked on [synthetic data generation](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.916/) and [llm alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16008).

Feel free to drop me an email (`ran.xu at emory dot edu`) if you have any questions about my research, or want to discuss about potential collaborations.
