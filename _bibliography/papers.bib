  abstract = 	 {Electronic Health Record modeling is crucial for digital medicine. However, existing models ignore higher-order interactions among medical codes and their causal relations towards downstream clinical predictions. To address such limitations, we propose a novel framework CACHE, to provide <em>effective</em> and <em>insightful</em> clinical predictions based on hypergraph representation learning and counterfactual and factual reasoning techniques. Experiments on two real EHR datasets show the superior performance of CACHE. Case studies with a domain expert illustrate a preferred capability of CACHE in generating clinically meaningful interpretations towards the correct predictions.}
